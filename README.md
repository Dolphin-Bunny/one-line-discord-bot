# one-line-discord-bot

I wanted to try to make a discord bot with just one line of code, so here it is
Its not a great bot, but it can be made better, I just don't feel like it

This is what the bot does:<br>
`.ping`: get latency of bot<br>
`.kick @user`: kick specified user from server<br>
`.warn @user reason`: warns specified user in DMs<br>
`.help`: displays a help message<br>
`.info`: displays information about this bot<br>

There is no invite link for the bot because I don't want to waste resources on it<br>
if you want moderation features, there are many bots that have more features and are actively developed and maintained
